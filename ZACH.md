## üöÄ **Feature Roadmap**

I've ranked the proposed features by complexity and development effort:

### **üü¢ LOW COMPLEXITY (Quick Wins)**

#### **1. Enhanced Live Interactions** ‚≠ê *Start Here*
Make the multiplayer experience more engaging and fun.

**Complexity**: Low ‚Ä¢ **Impact**: High ‚Ä¢ **Timeline**: 1-2 days

**Ideas to implement:**
- **Fireworks/Confetti**: Upgrade celebration effects for correct answers
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for interactions (optional/toggleable)
- **Animated Reactions**: Floating emoji with physics/bounce effects
- **Screen Shake**: Dynamic screen shake intensity based on score streaks
- **Winner Spotlight**: Animated winner announcement with particle effects

**Kick-off approach:**
- Start with [frontend/src/lib/components/AnswerEffects.svelte](frontend/src/lib/components/AnswerEffects.svelte)
- Add Canvas API or CSS animations for enhanced visual effects
- Use libraries like `canvas-confetti` or implement custom WebGL effects

#### **2. GitHub Actions for Auto-Deploy** 
Automate deployment pipeline for faster iteration.

**Complexity**: Low ‚Ä¢ **Impact**: Medium ‚Ä¢ **Timeline**: Half day

**Implementation approach:**
- Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Auto-deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages on `main` branch pushes
- Auto-deploy PartyKit backend on backend changes
- Add preview deployments for pull requests

**Kick-off steps:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml starter
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy-frontend:
    # Use wrangler action for Cloudflare Pages
  deploy-backend:
